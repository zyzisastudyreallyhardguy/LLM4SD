Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and polar functional groups tends to have a higher logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has more than twice as many carbon and hydrogen atoms compared to Molecule 2, which results in its higher logD value of 1.15 vs. 0.15 for Molecule 2. Similarly, Molecules 3 and 4 both contain multiple polar functional groups such as cyano and nitro groups, resulting in their high logD values of 2.20 and 2.50 respectively.
Rule 2: A molecule containing electronegative elements such as fluorine or chlorine tends to have a lower logD value due to their electron-withdrawing effect. For instance, Molecule 5 contains two fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring, leading to its low logD value of 2.00. On the other hand, Molecule 6 has no halogen atoms but still has a relatively low logD value of 1.43, likely due to its highly conjugated structure.
Rule 3: A molecule with a charged group such as a sulfonate or ammonium ion can have a significantly different logD value from its neutral form. For example, Molecule 7 has a charged sulfonate group, resulting in its much higher logD value of 3.63 compared to Molecule 8's neutral form with a logD value of only 3.30.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with polar functional groups such as amines, amides, and carboxylic acids tend to have higher logD values than nonpolar compounds without these groups. This is because they have stronger interactions with water molecules compared to octanol, resulting in increased hydrophilicity and lower lipophilicity. For example, molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 all contain polar functional groups and have high logD values ranging from 1.03 to 4.43.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds tend to have higher logD values due to their hydrophobic nature. These structures can interact strongly with octanol, leading to increased lipophilicity. For instance, molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 all contain one or more aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds and have relatively high logD values between 1.03 and 4.43.
Rule 3: Fluorine atoms can increase the lipophilicity of a compound by increasing its hydrophobicity. Therefore, molecules containing fluorine atoms tend to have higher logD values than those without them. For example, molecules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 all contain fluorine atoms and have significantly higher logD values than other molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. The presence of polar functional groups such as amines or carboxylic acids tends to increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule, resulting in lower logD values. For example, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.91 to 2.33 due to the presence of amine or carboxylic acid groups.
2. The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings tend to increase the lipophilicity of a molecule, resulting in higher logD values. For example, compound 7 has a high logD value of 4.40 due to the presence of two phenyl rings.
3. The position and orientation of functional groups also play a role in determining the lipophilicity of a molecule. For instance, compound 8 has a relatively high logD value of 3.84 despite having a polar functional group because it has a fluorine atom attached to one of the phenyl rings which increases its hydrophobicity. Similarly, compound 9 has a relatively low logD value of 1.03 even though it contains a polar functional group because it has a bulky tert-butyl group which reduces its ability to interact with water.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. The presence of polar functional groups such as amines or carboxylic acids decreases the logD value, indicating lower lipophilicity. For example, compound "CN1C(=O)CC(C1=O)c2ccccc2" has a low logD value of 0.68 due to the presence of two carbonyl groups.
2. The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains increases the logD value, indicating higher lipophilicity. For example, compounds "C[C@H](c1c[nH]cn1)c2cccc(C)c2C" and "Cc1nc(C)c(nc1C(=O)N)c2ccc3c(CC[C@@]34CC[C@@H](CC4)C(=O)O)c2" have high logD values of 2.79 and 1.20 respectively due to the presence of long alkyl chains.
3. The presence of charged functional groups such as sulfonates or phosphates also increase the logD value, indicating higher lipophilicity. For example, compound "CSc1ccc(OS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Br)cc2)cc1" has a high logD value of 3.50 due to the presence of a charged sulfonate group.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or an amine, it will have lower logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 contain polar functional groups and have low logD values ranging from -0.51 to 1.80.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexane ring, it will have higher logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, compounds 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 contain nonpolar functional groups and have high logD values ranging from 1.10 to 3.83.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a long carbon chain or a bulky substituent, it may have higher logD values due to its increased hydrophobicity. For example, compound 1 has a logD value of 1.80 while compound 17 has a logD value of 3.83 because the latter has a longer carbon chain and a more bulky substituent.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl group or an amine group, it tends to have lower logD values indicating higher hydrophilicity. For example, compounds #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20 all contain either a carbonyl group or an amine group and they have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.27 to 3.85.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it tends to have higher logD values indicating higher lipophilicity. For example, compound #21 has two phenyl rings and it has a high logD value of 4.23. Similarly, compound #22 also has two phenyl rings but it has a slightly lower logD value of 3.22 due to the presence of a polar functional group.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it tends to have moderate logD values depending on the position of the halogen atom in the molecule. For example, compound #23 has one chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring and it has a moderately high logD value of 2.16. However, if the same chlorine atom was attached to another carbon atom away from the benzene ring, the logD value would likely be different.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl or sulfonyl group, it tends to have low logD values (< 0.5) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, and #20 contain polar groups and have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.73 to 3.40.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it tends to have higher logD values (> 1.5) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For example, molecules #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, and #40 contain nonpolar groups and have relatively high logD values ranging from 0.05 to 3.70.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both polar and nonpolar functional groups, its logD value depends on the relative contribution of each group towards overall polarity. For example, molecule #4 has a polar sulfonyl group and a nonpolar phenyl ring, resulting in a moderate logD value of 

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with polar functional groups such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. tend to have lower logD values indicating higher hydrophilicity or solubility in water. For example, Molecule 1 has a sulfonamide group which is highly hydrophilic and has a low logD value of 0.47. On the other hand, nonpolar functional groups like alkyl chains, phenyl rings, etc. tend to increase hydrophobicity and lead to higher logD values. For instance, Molecule 10 has two chlorine atoms on its phenyl ring which make it more hydrophobic and has a high logD value of 3.70.
Rule 2: Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to be more lipophilic due to their planar structure and delocalized π electrons. For example, Molecule 11 has a naphthalene ring which is highly lipophilic and has a relatively high logD value of 2.70. In contrast, molecules without these structures tend to be less lipophilic. For instance, Molecule 12 has no aromatic ring and has a much lower logD value of 0.61.
Rule 3: Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms or negatively charged oxygen atoms tend to be more hydrophilic because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. For example, Molecule 13 has a quaternary ammonium group which is highly hydrophilic and has a low logD value of -0.42. However, if there are multiple ionizable groups present in a molecule, their overall effect on lipophilicity may depend on their relative positions and orientations within the molecule.

================================

Rule 1: Polar functional groups such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule while nonpolar functional groups like -CH3, -C≡C-, -C=C-, etc. increase its hydrophobicity. Therefore, if a molecule has more polar functional groups than nonpolar ones, it will have higher logD values indicating greater solubility in water compared to octanol. For example, Molecule 1 has two polar functional groups (-NO2 and -CONH-) which contribute to its high logD value of 3.72. On the other hand, Molecule 10 has only one polar group (-OH) but no nonpolar groups resulting in low logD value of 0.44.
Rule 2: The presence of halogen atoms increases the lipophilicity of a molecule due to their nonpolar nature. If a molecule contains multiple halogen atoms, it will have even higher logD values. For instance, Molecule 11 has three chlorine atoms leading to its relatively high logD value of 1.52. However, if there are too many halogen atoms present, they can disrupt the overall polarity of the molecule and reduce its aqueous solubility. This is why Molecule 12 has lower logD value despite having four fluorine atoms.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure also affect its lipophilicity. Longer and more complex structures tend to be less hydrophilic and more lipophilic. For example, Molecule 13 has a long carbon chain and a cyclic structure resulting in moderate logD value of 3.62. In contrast, Molecule 14 has a simple structure with only one ring and shorter carbon chains resulting in much lower logD value of 2.48.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl group or a sulfonyl group, it tends to have higher logD values than those without them. For example, Molecule 1 has a carbonyl group and has a high logD value of 3.32, while Molecule 10 does not contain any polar groups and has a low logD value of 0.80.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar alkyl chain, it tends to have lower logD values than those containing aromatic rings or other hydrophobic groups. For example, Molecule 11 has two nonpolar methyl groups and has a relatively low logD value of 1.75, while Molecule 12 has one phenyl ring and has a much higher logD value of 2.20.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom, it tends to have even higher logD values due to its increased hydrophobicity. For example, Molecule 13 has a protonated amine group and has a high logD value of 3.90, while Molecules 14 and 15 do not contain any positive charges and have moderate logD values of 2.20 and 1.50 respectively.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or amine, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30 all contain either a carboxylic acid or an amine group and have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.45 to 3.78.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or cyclohexyl ring, it will have high logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, molecules #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30 all contain either a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring and have relatively high logD values ranging from 0.60 to 3.60.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine or chlorine,

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. The presence of polar functional groups such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. increases the hydrophilicity of a molecule resulting in lower logD values. For example, Molecule 1 has a logD value of 0.47 which is relatively low compared to other molecules in the dataset due to the presence of two hydroxyl groups.
2. The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings increases the lipophilicity of a molecule resulting in higher logD values. For instance, Molecule 10 has a logD value of 3.62 which is significantly high compared to other molecules in the dataset due to the presence of four phenyl rings.
3. The number and position of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc. also affect the lipophilicity of a molecule. For example, Molecules 11 and 12 have similar structures but different logD values of 2.20 and 4.12 respectively. This difference can be attributed to the fact that Molecule 12 contains more nitrogen atoms than Molecule 11, making it more lipophilic.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more hydrophobic groups tends to have higher logD values, while those with more hydrophilic groups tend to have lower logD values. For example, in the given dataset, compounds 1, 2, and 3 contain aromatic rings which are known to be hydrophobic, resulting in high logD values of 3.90, 2.90, and 4.05 respectively. On the other hand, compound 10 contains only one polar group (-OH) on its phenyl ring, leading to a low logD value of 0.47.
Rule 2: The presence of electronegative atoms such as fluorine or chlorine can increase the polarity of a molecule, thereby reducing its hydrophobicity and lowering its logD value. This is evident from the fact that compound 4 has a relatively high logD value of 4.10 despite containing two halogen atoms (chlorines) due to the absence of any other polar functional groups. In contrast, compound 11 contains both fluorine and chlorine atoms along with several polar functional groups, resulting in a much lower logD value of 2.50.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure also play a role in determining its lipophilicity. Longer and more complex structures tend to have lower logD values because they require more space within the lipid bilayer, making it harder for them to penetrate into cells. For instance, compound 12 has a simple linear structure without any branches or rings, resulting in a moderate logD value of 3.20. However, compound 13 has a highly branched structure with multiple rings and functional groups, causing it to have a significantly lower logD value of 1.23.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -OH or -COOH, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, in compound number 1, the -OH group makes it highly water-soluble, resulting in a low logD value of -1.18.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it will have high logD values due to its lipophilic nature. For instance, compounds numbers 10 and 11 contain long alkyl chains which make them hydrophobic, leading to high logD values of 3.45 and 3.54 respectively.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both polar and nonpolar groups, its logD value will depend on the relative strength of each group's interaction with water and octanol. For example, compound number 12 has a relatively high logD value of 2.60 despite containing a polar -NH group because the phenyl ring makes it more lipophilic than other compounds in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a polar functional group such as -OH, -COOH, or -NH2 has high logD values due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. For example, Molecule 1 has a carbonyl group (-C=O) which is highly polar and has a logD value of 1.13. On the other hand, nonpolar groups like alkyl chains tend to decrease the logD value. For instance, Molecule 10 has two alkyl chains on the benzene ring and has a low logD value of 0.85.
Rule 2: Molecules with conjugated double bonds have higher logD values than those without conjugation. This is because the pi electrons in the conjugated system can interact with water molecules through dipole-dipole interactions, increasing the overall polarity of the molecule. For example, Molecule 11 has a logD value of 2.44 while Molecule 12 does not have any conjugated double bonds and has a lower logD value of 1.32.
Rule 3: Fluorine atoms increase the lipophilicity of a molecule by introducing a strong electron-withdrawing effect that reduces the polarity of the molecule. Therefore, molecules containing fluorine atoms tend to have higher logD values compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts. For example, Molecule 13 contains one fluorine atom and has a relatively high logD value of 2.90 whereas Molecule 14 does not contain any fluorine atoms and has a much lower logD value of 1.87.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -OH, -COOH, or -SO3H, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, Molecule #1 has a sulfonyl group which makes it highly polar and results in a negative logD value of -0.96.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it will have high logD values due to its lipophilic nature. For instance, Molecule #10 has two phenyl rings which make it highly hydrophobic and result in a high logD value of 3.06.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains both polar and nonpolar groups, its logD value will depend on the relative strength of each group's contribution towards hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. For example, Molecule #11 has one polar carbonyl group and one nonpolar alkyl chain, resulting in a moderate logD value of 1.27.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, double bonds, and rings tends to have a higher logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has 20 carbons, 4 double bonds, and one ring, which contributes to its high logD value of 2.65. Similarly, Molecules 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16 also have relatively high logD values due to their large size and complex structures.
Rule 2: Functional groups such as carbonyls, amides, and sulfonamides tend to increase the logD value of a molecule. For instance, Molecule 1 contains a carbonyl group, which increases its logD value from 0.60 for Molecule 15 without this functional group. Additionally, Molecules 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 17 contain these functional groups, which contribute to their moderate or high logD values.
Rule 3: Halogen substituents can significantly affect the logD value of a molecule. For example, replacing chlorine in Molecule 1 by bromine in Molecule 18 decreases its logD value from 3.66 to 2.50. This is because halogen atoms increase the polarity of a molecule, making it more hydrophilic. Therefore, molecules containing fluorine, chlorine, or bromine tend to have lower logD values than those without them.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a sulfonyl group or a nitro group, it tends to have low logD values (< 1) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, NS(=O)(=O)NC(=O)CCCc1c([nH]c2ccc(cc12)C#N)c3ccc(F)cc3 has a logD value of 1.95 due to the presence of a sulfonyl group.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring, it tends to have higher logD values (> 2) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For example, C[C@H]1O[C@H]([C@H](O)[C@@H]1O)n2cnc3c(N)nc(OCC45CC6CC(CC(C6)C4)C5)nc23 has a logD value of 3.58 due to the presence of a phenyl ring.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as a carboxylate group or a quaternary ammonium group, it tends to have even higher logD values (> 3) indicating further increased hydrophobicity. For example, O[C@@H](CNCCOc1cccc(CNCCc2ccccc2F)c1)c3ccc(O)c4NC(=O)Sc34 has a logD value of 1.86 due to the presence of a carboxylate group.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -COOH or -OH, it will have lower logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, Molecule 1 has a logD value of 1.83 which is relatively low compared to other molecules in the dataset.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as -CH3 or -Cl, it will have higher logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, Molecule 3 has a logD value of 4.14 which is one of the highest among all the molecules in the dataset.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as -NH+ or -COO-, it will have intermediate logD values depending on the polarity of the rest of the molecule. For example, Molecule 10 has a logD value of 2.50 which is moderate compared to other molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl group or a nitro group, it tends to have low logD values (< 0.5) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, compounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 contain polar groups and have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.65 to 2.09.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring, it tends to have higher logD values (> 2.5) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For instance, compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 possess nonpolar groups and have relatively high logD values varying between 1.13 and 4.31.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a basic nitrogen atom, it may have a higher logD value due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. For example, compound 19 has a basic nitrogen atom and has one of the highest logD values among all the compounds listed in the table (3.65).

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, halogen atoms or polar functional groups tends to have a higher logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has 12 carbon atoms, one chlorine atom, and two polar functional groups (carbonyl and ether group) which contribute to its high logD value of 3.30. Similarly, Molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 also follow this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyclic structure, it may have a lower logD value compared to a linear chain counterpart. This can be seen in comparing Molecule 1 versus Molecule 2 where the former has a cyclopropane ring while the latter has a linear alkyl chain. Therefore, Molecule 2 has a slightly higher logD value than Molecule 1 due to its increased hydrophobicity from the longer aliphatic chain.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as a carboxylate ion or sulfonate ion, it will have a much higher logD value because of its strong hydrophilicity. For instance, Molecule 21 has a carboxylate ion which contributes to its extremely low logD value of 0.00. On the other hand, if a molecule contains a neutral but polar functional group like a hydroxyl group, it may still have a relatively high logD value depending on its overall molecular structure.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or amine, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 all contain polar functional groups and have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.7 to 3.1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or alkyl chain, it will have high logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, compounds 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 all contain nonpolar functional groups and have relatively high logD values ranging from 1.0 to 4.2.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it will increase its lipophilicity and result in higher logD values. For example, compound 1 has a logD value of 1.08 while compound 2 has a slightly higher logD value of 2.08 due to the presence of a bromine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Similarly, compound 4 has a lower logD value of 1.18 compared to compound 5 which has a much higher logD value of 3.70 due to the presence of two fluorine atoms instead of one chlorine atom.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and halogen atoms tends to have a lower logD value due to its increased hydrophobicity. For example, Molecule #1 has fewer carbon atoms than Molecules #2 and #3 but has a slightly higher logD value because it does not contain any halogen atoms or nitrogen atoms. Similarly, Molecule #10 has more carbon atoms and chlorine atoms compared to other molecules in the dataset, resulting in the lowest logD value among all the molecules.
Rule 2: A molecule containing polar functional groups such as carbonyl groups (e.g., CO, C=O), hydroxyl groups (e.g., OH), and amine groups (e.g., NH) tend to have a higher logD value since they increase hydrophilicity. For instance, Molecule #1 contains two carbonyl groups, which contribute to its high logD value of 3.80. On the other hand, Molecule #11 lacks these polar functional groups, leading to its low logD value of 0.62.
Rule 3: A molecule with a larger molecular weight and a more complex structure tends to have a higher logD value. This can be seen by comparing Molecule #1 with Molecule #12, where the latter has twice the molecular weight of the former and also contains additional rings and double bonds. As a result, Molecule #12 has a much higher logD value of 4.25 compared to Molecule #1's logD value of 3.80.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or a sulfonamide, it will have low logD values (< 1) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95,

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl or sulfonyl group, it tends to have low logD values (< 1) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, molecules 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 contain polar groups and have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.27 to 1.33.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or alkyl chain, it tends to have higher logD values (> 1) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For example, molecules 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 contain nonpolar groups and have relatively high logD values ranging from 0.49 to 3.70.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as a quaternary ammonium or carboxylate ion, it tends to have even higher logD values due to its increased hydrophobicity. For example, molecules 22 and 23 contain charged groups and have the highest logD values among all the molecules listed in this dataset.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -OH, -COOH, or -NH2, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, Molecule 1 has a hydroxyl group and has a logD value of 1.99.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it will have high logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, Molecule 2 has two phenyl rings and has a logD value of 2.28.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both polar and nonpolar groups, its logD value will depend on the relative contribution of each group towards hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. For example, Molecule 3 has one polar group (-CN) and one nonpolar group (-Ph), and has a moderate logD value of 3.05.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. The presence of polar functional groups such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. increases the hydrophilicity of a molecule and decreases its logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has a logD value of 3.80 which indicates high hydrophobicity due to the absence of any polar functional group. On the other hand, Molecule 10 has a low logD value of 0.02 because it contains two polar hydroxyl groups.
2. The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings increases the lipophilicity of a molecule and increases its logD value. For instance, Molecule 2 has a logD value of 3.20 which suggests moderate hydrophobicity due to the presence of a fluorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring. Similarly, Molecule 11 has a relatively higher logD value of 3.90 due to the presence of two phenyl rings connected by a carbonyl group.
3. The number and position of nitrogen atoms in a molecule also affect its lipophilicity. Molecules containing multiple nitrogen atoms tend to have lower logD values than those with fewer nitrogen atoms. Additionally, the position of the nitrogen atom affects the overall polarity of the molecule. For example, Molecule 12 has a much higher logD value of 4.12 compared to Molecule 13 which has a logD value of only 1.84 despite having similar structures except for the position of the nitrogen atom.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl group or an amine group, it tends to have lower logD values indicating higher hydrophilicity. For example, molecules 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20 contain either a carbonyl group or an amine group and they all have low logD values ranging from 0.60 to 3.22.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring, it tends to have higher logD values indicating higher hydrophobicity. For example, molecules 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 contain either a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring and they all have high logD values ranging from 2.57 to 4.20.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it tends to have slightly higher logD values compared to similar molecules without halogens. For example, compare molecules 3 and 18; both contain a phenyl ring but molecule 3 has two chlorines while molecule 18 does not have any halogens. Molecule 3 has a higher logD value than molecule 18 (3.18 vs 2.00) due to the presence of the chlorine atoms.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more nonpolar functional groups tends to have higher logD values, indicating greater lipophilicity. For example, in the given dataset, molecules such as NC1(CCC1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ncc4ccncc4c3c5ccccc5 (logD 2.20) and C[C@H]1CN(Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2CC(=O)O)CCN1S(=O)(=O)Cc3ccccc3 (logD 1.12) contain multiple nonpolar functional groups like alkyl chains and halogen atoms, which contribute to their high logD values. On the other hand, molecules like COc1cc(OC2CCN(C)CC2)c3c(Nc4cccc5OCOc45)ncnc3c1 (logD 3.02) and Nc1nnc(CCSCCc2nnc(NC(=O)Cc3ccccc3)s2)s1 (logD 2.00) have polar functional groups like carbonyl and sulfonyl groups, which decrease their overall lipophilicity.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower logD values compared to those without them. This can be seen from the fact that molecules like CC(C)n1c(C)ncc1c2ccnc(Nc3ccc(C(=O)NCCN(C)C)c(F)c3)n2 (logD 1.96) and OC(=O)NOc1ccc(Br)cc1c2ccccc2 (logD 0.15) have no aromatic rings but have relatively low logD values. In contrast, molecules like CNS(=O)(=O)CCc1ccc2[nH]cc(C3CCN(C)CC3)c2c1 (logD 

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or an amine, it tends to have low logD values (< 0.5) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 all contain either a carboxylic acid or an amine group and have relatively low logD values ranging from -0.93 to 4.10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexane ring, it tends to have higher logD values (> 2.5) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For example, compound 31 has a logD value of 2.54 due to the presence of a phenyl ring in its structure. Similarly, compounds 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 all contain either a phenyl ring or a cyclohexane ring and have relatively high logD values ranging from 1.14 to 4.10.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, halogen atoms or aromatic rings tends to have a higher logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has one chlorine atom and three carbon atoms, which gives it a high logD value of 2.80. Similarly, Molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 also follow this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains polar functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, cyano, nitro, or amino groups, its logD value decreases significantly due to increased polarity. For instance, Molecule 21 has a sulfonyl group, which makes it highly polar and results in a low logD value of -0.82. On the other hand, if a molecule lacks these polar functional groups, its logD value increases. This can be seen in Molecules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, its logD value may increase slightly compared to a similar molecule without the heterocycle. For example, compare Molecule 22 with Molecule 23; both contain a phenyl ring but Molecule 22 has a thiazole ring while Molecule 23 does not. As a result, Molecule 22 has a slightly higher logD value than Molecule 23.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. The presence of polar functional groups such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. increases the hydrophilicity of a molecule and decreases its logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has a logD value of 0.44 which indicates it is relatively hydrophilic compared to other molecules in the dataset. This is likely due to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule.
2. The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings increases the lipophilicity of a molecule and increases its logD value. For example, Molecule 10 has a logD value of 3.58 which indicates it is highly lipophilic. This is likely due to the presence of two phenyl rings in the molecule.
3. The position and orientation of functional groups within a molecule also affect its lipophilicity. For example, compare Molecules 1 and 2. While both molecules have similar structures, Molecule 2 has a higher logD value of 2.10 than Molecule 1's logD value of 0.44. This may be because the carbonyl group (-C=O) in Molecule 2 is oriented towards the center of the molecule making it more hydrophobic than the same group in Molecule 1 which is oriented towards the outside of the molecule.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a polar functional group such as -OH, -COOH, or -NH2 tends to have lower logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, Molecule 1 has a hydroxyl group which makes it more water soluble than other molecules in this dataset. Therefore, it has a low logD value of 2.48.
Rule 2: Molecules with nonpolar groups like alkyl chains tend to have higher logD values because they are hydrophobic. For instance, Molecule 10 has two alkyl chains attached to the central carbon atom, resulting in a high logD value of 3.90.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both polar and nonpolar groups, its logD value will depend on how well these groups are balanced. For example, Molecule 11 has one polar carbonyl group and one nonpolar phenyl ring connected by a single bond. Its logD value is relatively moderate at 1.94.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or amine, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, molecules 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19 have relatively low logD values ranging from 0.15 to 2.88.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or alkene, it will have high logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, molecules 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 18 have relatively high logD values ranging from 1.38 to 4.30.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as a sulfonate or phosphate, it will have intermediate logD values depending on the polarity of the rest of the molecule. For example, molecule 1 has a sulfonate group and has a logD value of 1.31, while molecule 20 has a phosphate group and has a logD value of 0.58.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -OH, -COOH, or -NH2, it will have lower logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, Molecule 1 has a logD value of 2.72 which is relatively low compared to other molecules in the dataset. This is because it contains two hydroxyl groups that increase its hydrophilicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it will have higher logD values due to its lipophilic nature. For example, Molecule 3 has a logD value of 3.76 which is one of the highest among all the molecules in the dataset. This is because it contains four phenyl rings that increase its lipophilicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as -COO- or -SO3-, it will have intermediate logD values depending on the polarity of the rest of the molecule. For example, Molecule 10 has a logD value of 3.40 which is moderate compared to other molecules in the dataset. This is because it contains both a carboxylic acid group and a sulfonamide group that make it moderately hydrophobic.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of chlorine atoms tends to have a higher logD value, indicating increased lipophilicity. For example, compare the logD values of compounds 1 and 2 where compound 1 has one chlorine atom and compound 2 has two chlorine atoms. Compound 2 has a higher logD value than compound 1.
Rule 2: A molecule with a polar functional group such as -COOH or -OH tends to have a lower logD value, indicating decreased lipophilicity. For example, compare the logD values of compounds 3 and 4 where compound 3 has no polar functional groups while compound 4 has a polar functional group -COOH. Compound 4 has a lower logD value than compound 3.
Rule 3: A molecule with a nonpolar functional group such as -CH3 or -CF3 tends to have a higher logD value, indicating increased lipophilicity. For example, compare the logD values of compounds 5 and 6 where compound 5 has no nonpolar functional groups while compound 6 has a nonpolar functional group -CF3. Compound 6 has a higher logD value than compound 5.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and halogen atoms tends to have a higher logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has 20 carbon atoms, 28 hydrogen atoms, and no halogen atoms, while Molecule 10 has only one chlorine atom but has a much higher logD value of 3.85 compared to Molecule 1's logD value of 1.22.
Rule 2: A molecule with a polar functional group such as -COOH or -OH tends to have a lower logD value due to its hydrophilic nature. For instance, Molecule 11 has a -COOH group and has a low logD value of -0.49, whereas Molecule 12 does not have any polar groups and has a high logD value of 3.30.
Rule 3: A molecule with a nonpolar functional group such as -CH3 or -C≡N tends to have a higher logD value due to its hydrophobic nature. For example, Molecule 13 has two -CH3 groups and has a relatively high logD value of 2.62, while Molecule 14 has a -C≡N group and has a moderate logD value of 1.70.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms, halogen atoms, and polar functional groups tends to have a higher logD value. For example, Molecule 1 has only one chlorine atom and no other polar functional group, resulting in a low logD value of 0.38. On the other hand, Molecule 10 has four chlorine atoms and two polar functional groups (carbonyl and cyano groups), leading to a high logD value of 3.10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring or a conjugated system, it tends to have a lower logD value due to its increased polarity. For instance, Molecule 11 has a furan ring, which is more polar than a benzene ring, resulting in a relatively low logD value of 1.31. Similarly, Molecule 12 has a highly polarized double bond between C1 and O1, causing it to be more hydrophilic and having a lower logD value of 0.10.
Rule 3: Molecules containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to have higher logD values compared to those without such rings. This is because nitrogen atoms can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them more lipophilic. For example, Molecule 13 has a pyridine ring, which has a higher logD value of 3.92 compared to Molecule 14's logD value of 2.50 despite both molecules having similar structures except for the presence of a pyrimidine ring instead of a pyridine ring.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms tends to have a higher logD value, indicating increased lipophilicity. For example, Molecule 1 has only one carbon atom in its structure, while Molecule 10 has 16 carbon atoms, resulting in a logD value of 0.20 and 3.10 respectively.
Rule 2: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine can increase the logD value due to their hydrophobic nature. For instance, Molecule 11 has two chlorine atoms attached to the phenyl ring, which increases its logD value from 2.13 for Molecule 10 without any halogens present.
Rule 3: The addition of polar functional groups such as amines, amides, or sulfonamides decreases the logD value by increasing polarity. For example, Molecule 12 has a sulfonamide group added to the phenyl ring, reducing its logD value from 2.13 for Molecule 10.

================================

Rule 1: Polar functional groups such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule while nonpolar functional groups like -CH3, -C≡C-, -C=C-, etc. increase its hydrophobicity.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule increases its hydrophobicity due to the π-π interactions between the rings and the hydrophobic regions of the cell membrane.
Rule 3: The length of the carbon chain also affects the lipophilicity of a molecule. Longer chains tend to be more lipophilic than shorter ones.
Based on these three rules, we can make predictions about the lipophilicity of new molecules based on their structure.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl or sulfonyl group, it tends to have lower logD values indicating higher hydrophilicity. For example, molecules 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, and 22 contain polar groups and have low logD values ranging from -0.84 to 3.10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it tends to have higher logD values indicating higher lipophilicity. For example, molecules 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 contain nonpolar groups and have high logD values ranging from 1.00 to 4.20.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains positively charged nitrogen atoms, it tends to have even higher logD values due to increased lipophilicity. For example, molecules 23 and 24 contain positively charged nitrogen atoms and have extremely high logD values of 2.39 and 2.95 respectively.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with polar functional groups such as amines, amides, carboxylic acids, and sulfonamides tends to have higher logD values than those without these groups. This is because they have stronger interactions with water molecules due to their hydrophilic nature. For example, in the first molecule, the sulfonamide group has a high logD value of 1.14 compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 2: Molecules with nonpolar functional groups such as alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics tend to have lower logD values than those with polar functional groups. This is because they have weaker interactions with water molecules due to their hydrophobic nature. For example, in the last molecule, the alkene group has a low logD value of -0.35 compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine can increase the logD value of a molecule by increasing its hydrophobicity. For example, in the second molecule, the chlorine atom has a high logD value of 2.90 compared to other molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -OH, -NH2 or -COOH, it will have low logD values indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, N[C@@H](Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12)C(=O)O has a logD value of -1.08 due to the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar groups such as alkyl chains or phenyl rings, it will have higher logD values indicating increased lipophilicity. For instance, Brc1ccc(s1)N2C[C@@]3(CN4CCC3CC4)OC2=O has a logD value of 2.00 because of the presence of a bromine atom which is a hydrophobic substituent.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged group such as -SO3- or -PO4-, it will have even higher logD values indicating further increase in lipophilicity. For example, CC(C)C(NC(=O)CN1C(=O)C(=CC=C1c2ccccc2)NC(=O)Cc3ccc(cc3)C(=O)O)C(=O)C(F)(F)F has a logD value of 0.35 due to the presence of a phosphonic acid group.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carbonyl group or a sulfonyl group, it tends to have low logD values (< 1) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, and 22 all contain polar functional groups and have relatively low logD values.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring, it tends to have higher logD values (> 2) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For example, compounds 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 18 all contain nonpolar functional groups and have relatively high logD values.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a long alkyl chain or a fluorinated alkyl chain, it also tends to have higher logD values due to increased hydrophobicity. For example, compound 21 has a long alkyl chain and has one of the highest logD values in the dataset. Similarly, compound 23 has a fluorinated alkyl chain and has a moderate logD value.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more carbon atoms tends to have higher logD values, indicating greater lipophilicity. For example, Molecule 1 has 20 carbon atoms and its logD value is 3.02, while Molecule 10 has only one carbon atom and its logD value is 0.57.
Rule 2: A molecule with polar functional groups such as amines or carboxylic acids tend to have lower logD values due to their hydrophilic nature. For instance, Molecule 1 contains two amine groups and its logD value is 3.02, whereas Molecule 11 has no polar functional group and its logD value is 4.13.
Rule 3: A molecule with nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or phenyl rings tend to have higher logD values due to their hydrophobic nature. For example, Molecule 10 contains four phenyl rings and its logD value is 4.10, while Molecule 12 has three alkyl chains and its logD value is 1.20.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as -OH, -COOH, or -NH2, it will have low logD values due to its hydrophilic nature. For example, molecules like CCN1CCCC1CNC(=O)c2cc(ccc2OC)S(=O)(=O)N and CN(C)c1cccc2c(cccc12)S(=O)(=O)N have relatively high negative logD values because they contain polar functional groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, it will have higher logD values due to its hydrophobic nature. For instance, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2F has a high positive logD value since it contains a chlorine atom which is a nonpolar functional group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as -SO3- or -PO4-, it will also have lower logD values even if it contains nonpolar functional groups. This is because the charge on the ion makes it more hydrophilic than neutral compounds. For example, Clc1cccc(c1)S(=O)(=O)NC(=O)N2CCC(CC2)N3CCC(CC3)Oc4ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c4 has a slightly negative logD value despite containing several nonpolar functional groups because it contains a negatively charged sulfonyl group.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more nonpolar functional groups tends to have higher logD values, indicating greater lipophilicity. For example, in the given dataset, molecules such as CN[C@@H](C)C(=O)N[C@@H](C1CCCCC1)C(=O)N[C@H]2CCCN(CCc3ccc(F)cc3)C2 (with two nonpolar alkyl chains) has a high logD value of 2.39. On the other hand, molecules like COCCOc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(c3)C#C)c2cc1OCCOC (with polar ester groups) has a low logD value of 1.33.
Rule 2: Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms tend to have lower logD values due to electrostatic repulsion between the positive charge and the octanol phase. In the given dataset, molecules like Cc1cccc(Br)c1C(=O)N[C@@H](Cc2ccc(NC(=O)c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)cc2)C(=O)O (with a positively charged nitrogen atom) has a relatively low logD value of -0.13. However, if the same nitrogen atom is part of a ring system or conjugated system, it may have less impact on its overall lipophilicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher logD values than those without them. This is because the π-electrons in the aromatic ring can interact with the octanol phase through hydrophobic interactions. For instance, CC(C)N1CCC[C@H](CN2C(=O)c3cc(ccc3N=C2C(C)C)c4ccc(F)cc4)C1 (with an aromatic phenyl ring) has a high logD value of 3.60.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more hydrophobic groups tends to have higher logD values, while those with more hydrophilic groups tend to have lower logD values. For example, in the given dataset, molecules such as N(c1ccccc1)c2ncnc3ccccc23 and Clc1cccc(C(=O)N2CCN(CC2)c3ccccn3)c1Cl have relatively high logD values due to the presence of hydrophobic groups like phenyl rings or chlorine atoms. On the other hand, molecules like COc1ccc(cc1)C(=O)NCc2cn(nn2)c3cc(C)nc4ccc(OC)cc34 and FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)S(=O)(=O)NC(=O)N2CCC(CC2)N3CCC(CC3)Oc4ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c4 have low logD values because they contain polar functional groups like carbonyl, sulfonyl, or fluoro groups.
Rule 2: The length of the carbon chain also affects the lipophilicity of a molecule. Generally, longer chains lead to increased hydrophobicity and higher logD values. In the given dataset, molecules like C[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1[C@H]2[C@@H](C)C(=C(N2C1=O)C(=O)OCOC(=O)C(C)(C)C)SC3CN(C3)C4=NCCS4 and CC1=C(C(=O)Oc2cc(O)ccc12)c3ccc(O)cc3 have long alkyl chains that contribute to their high logD values.
Rule 3: The presence of electronegative atoms like fluorine can increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule and decrease its logD value. For instance, molecules like FCF(F)SO2NH2 and O

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Molecules containing polar functional groups such as amines or carboxylic acids tend to have higher logD values than those without them. For example, Molecule 1 has no polar functional group and has a low logD value of 1.00, while Molecule 10 contains a polar amine group and has a high logD value of 4.26.
2. Molecules with nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings tend to have lower logD values than those with polar functional groups. For instance, Molecule 11 has two nonpolar phenyl rings and has a relatively low logD value of 0.14, whereas Molecule 10 has one polar amine group and one nonpolar phenyl ring and has a much higher logD value of 4.26.
3. Molecules with electronegative atoms such as fluorine or chlorine tend to have higher logD values due to increased polarity. For example, Molecule 12 has two fluorines and has a moderate logD value of 2.80, while Molecule 13 has two chlorines and has a significantly higher logD value of 3.63.

================================

Based on these data, here are three rules that can be used to predict the lipophilicity of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a sulfonyl group or a carbonyl group, it tends to have low logD values (< 1) indicating high hydrophilicity. For example, compound "O=S(=O)(Nc1cccnc1)c2cccs2" has a logD value of 0.54 which is relatively low compared to other compounds in the dataset.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as an alkyl chain or an aromatic ring, it tends to have higher logD values (> 2) indicating increased hydrophobicity. For instance, compound "Cn1cc(C)c(C)c1" has a logD value of 3.53 which is one of the highest among all compounds in the dataset.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as a quaternary ammonium group or a carboxylate group, it tends to have even higher logD values (> 3) due to the electrostatic interaction between the charge and water molecules. For example, compound "C[NH+](C)C(=O)NNC(=O)CSc1ccc(Br)cc1" has a logD value of 4.00 which is significantly higher than any other compound in the dataset.
