Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phenol group (-OH attached to an aromatic ring), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like "O=C1O[C@H]([C@@H](O)CO)C(O)=C1O", "COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)O", and "O=C(c1ccc(O)cc1)c1ccc(O)cc1O" which all contain a phenol group.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-NHSO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like "Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[O-])cc1" and "O=C(NC(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)NC(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl" which both contain a sulfonamide group.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have some level of toxicity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 6

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and no other functional groups or rings, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like CCCCCOC(=O)CCC(C)=O, COCCCOCCCOC, O=C(O)C=Cc1ccc(O)c(O)c1, CC(C)=CCCC(C)C=O, C=C[Si](C)(C)O[Si](C)(C)C=C, O=C1C(N(CO)C(=O)NCO)N(CO)C(=O)N1CO, COP(=S)(Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl)c1ccccc1, CCSCCCOC(=O)COc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, c1ccc2c(c1)CCc1ccccc1N2, ClCCCCCCCl, NC(=O)Oc1ccc(Cc2ccccc2)cc1, and C=CCOc1ccccc1OCC(O)CNC(C)C.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to compounds 6, 8, 9, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, and 36.
Rule 2: If a compound contains halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, then it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to compounds 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 34.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies only to compound 7.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting toxicity without further testing.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a bromine atom (Br), then it is likely to have no toxic effects and should receive a label of 0. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 9, 18, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it is likely to have toxic effects and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecule 12.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it is likely to have toxic effects and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecule 16.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may not apply to all types of molecules. Additionally, other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility can also affect the toxicity of a substance.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because these functional groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological molecules, leading to adverse health outcomes. For example, the first two SMILES strings in the dataset contain such groups and both have been labeled as having toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because halogens can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, which can alter their function and lead to negative consequences. The fifth and sixth SMILES strings in the dataset contain such groups and both have been labeled as having toxic effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring (such as pyridine or pyrimidine), then it is less likely to have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because such rings are commonly found in natural products and drugs, and are generally considered to be safe for human use. However, it's important to note that there are exceptions to this rule, and some nitrogen-containing rings can still have toxic

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without this functional group. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting with CCC or CCO. For example, the first two molecules in the dataset contain a carbonyl group and have a label of 1, indicating they have potential toxic effects. The third molecule does not contain a carbonyl group but still has a label of 1 due to other structural features that may contribute to toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it is also more likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings containing N(O)R1R2 where R1 and R2 are any organic groups. For example, the sixth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and has a label of 1. However, note that not all molecules with nitro groups will necessarily have toxic effects, as other factors such as dose and exposure time can also play a role.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I), then it is less likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings containing F, Cl, Br, or I atoms. For example, the last four molecules in the dataset do not contain a carbonyl or nitro group

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO32-), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 17, 20, and 21.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may not have any toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 12 and 13.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 14 and 15.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting toxicity without further testing.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a germanium atom (Ge), then it is likely to have toxic activity and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecules 5, 9, 16, and 27.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond such as a carbon-carbon triple bond (-C≡C-) or a silicon-oxygen double bond (-Si=O), then it is also likely to have toxic activity and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecules 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it may have toxic activity but further analysis would be needed to confirm its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule applies to molecule 2 only.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of data and may need to

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom bonded to an oxygen atom through a double bond (O=C(O)Br), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by a label of 1. This rule is based on the fact that bromine atoms are known to increase the reactivity of molecules and may interact with biological systems in ways that lead to toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of alternating single and double bonds, such as in the case of CC(C)=CCC/C(C)=C/CC/C(C)=C/CC/C=C(\C)CC/C=C(\C)CCC=C(C)C, then it is also likely to have toxic effects as indicated by a label of 1. Conjugated systems are often associated with increased reactivity and may interact with biological systems in ways that lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom in a ring structure (CS/C(C)=N/OC(=O)N(C)SN(C)C(=O)O/N=C(\C)SC), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by a label of 0. Sulfur-containing rings are common in natural products and do not typically exhibit significant toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring with at least one hydroxyl group attached to it, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like NC1nc(N)nc(-c2ccccc2)n1, Cc1cc(C(C)(C)c2ccc(O)c(C)c2)ccc1O, Nc1ccccc1C(=O)OCCc1ccccc1, O=C(O)/C=C/c1ccccc1, COc1ccc(Br)c(C)c1, N#CC(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, Nc1nc(=O)n([C@@H]2CS[C@H](CO)O2)cc1F, CC(C)=CC1C(C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2)C1(C)C, CO[Si](OC)(OC)c1ccccc1, O=[N+]([O-])c1ccccc1, CCC(=O)N[C@@

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and no other functional groups, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like COC(=O)c1ccc(CBr)cc1 and CC[N+](C)(CC)CC.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and no other functional groups, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules like Cc1cc(C)c(C(=O)O)c(C)c1 and O=C(O)COCC(=O)O.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and no other functional groups, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules like Oc1ccccc1Cl and N[C@@H](Cc1ccc(N(CCCl)CCCl)cc1)C(=O)O.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may not apply to all types of molecules or biological systems. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for more accurate predictions.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc2c(c1)Cc1ccccc1-2 1.0.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a chlorine atom, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 0). This rule applies to molecules like COC(=O)OC 0.0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and a cyano group (-CN), then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 0). This rule applies to molecules like CC(C)OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 1.0.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may not apply to all types of molecules or biological systems. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for more accurate predictions.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a CC(C)(C) group, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like the first one listed in the dataset where the SMILES string is labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a Cc1ccc(C)o1 or O=C(Cl)c1cc(C(=O)Cl)cc(C(=O)Cl)c1 group, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. These groups may indicate that the molecule is too hydrophobic or polar, respectively, which may affect its ability to interact with the target protein. Both of these rules apply to molecules like the third and fourth ones listed in the dataset where the SMILES strings are labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a COC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 or CCC(CC)C(=O)OCCOCCOCCOC(=O)C(CC)CCCC group, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. These groups may indicate that the molecule contains functional groups that are important for binding to the target protein. The last two molecules listed in the dataset contain such groups and their SMILES strings

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because these functional groups are known to interact with receptors in the NR family and disrupt their normal function. The molecules containing these groups in the provided dataset all have labels of 1, indicating they do indeed have such toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) bonded to a sulfate group (-OSO3-), then it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because Na+ ions can interfere with the binding of ligands to receptors in the NR family, leading to dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways. The molecule containing both Na+ and SO42- in the provided dataset has a label of 1, supporting this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring structure, then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because Cl atoms can act as electron-withdrawing groups, which can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and potentially affect their interactions with receptors in the NR family. The two molecules containing Cl atoms in the provided dataset both have labels of 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it is also likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (-C10H7), then it may have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2. It applies to molecules 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or iodine (I) attached to a benzene ring, then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to a carbon atom that is part of a cyclic structure, then it may also have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. However, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing C=O groups, so additional factors should be considered when predicting toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (SH), then it is less likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. Molecules without SH groups were mostly labeled as 1, while those with SH groups were mainly labeled as 0.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules O=S(O)CO[Na] and O=C=NC1CCCCC1 respectively.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms (-Cl), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, Cn1cnc2c1c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2C, C=C(C)C(=O)OCCCC, CCc1cnc(C(=O)O)c(C(=O)O)c1, O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(CCO)cc1, NC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, N#CCCCl, CCC(C)(CN(C)C)OC(=O)c1ccccc1, COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC, Oc1ccc(Cl

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES notation "C=O" or "CO"), then it may have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO), which is known to be highly toxic due to its ability to bind to hemoglobin and prevent oxygen transport throughout the body.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the SMILES notation "NO2" or "Nc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1[N+](=O)[O-]"), then it may also have toxic effects. Nitro compounds are commonly used as explosives but can also be harmful if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (represented by the SMILES notation "X" where X is any halogen element), then it may also have toxic effects. Halogen atoms can react with other molecules in the body and form reactive species that can damage cells and tissues. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since some halogens, such as fluorine, are often used in pharmaceuticals and are considered safe at low concentrations.

================================

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO32-), then it may have toxic effects. The first two molecules in the dataset contain such groups and both have been labeled as having toxicity activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have toxic effects. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains this group and has been labeled as having toxicity activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a phenyl ring or a polyene chain, then it may also have toxic effects. This is because conjugation can increase the reactivity of the molecule and make it more susceptible to oxidation or other types of chemical reactions. The last four molecules in the dataset all contain such systems and have been labeled as having toxicity activity.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings Cl[Zn]Cl, Cc1cc(C(C)(C)C)c(O)c(C)c1CC1=NCCN1, c1ccc2[nH]cnc2c1, CCON(C)C(F)(F)F, O=C([O-])C(=O)[O-].
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group like carbonyl (C=O) or sulfonyl (SO2R), then it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings CCC(=O)OCCc1ccccc1, CCS(=O)(=O)NNC(=O)CS(=O)(=O)C, COC(=O)c1c(C)cc(O)c(C)c1O, NCC(=O)OS(=O)(=O)C, OC(C)(C)C(=O)Oc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccccc2C(=O)NCC(=O)[O-])cc1.
Rule 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of the label "1" for some molecules containing these groups. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases where a molecule will exhibit toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it almost always has potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of the label "1" for most molecules containing this group. This rule is more reliable than Rule 1 but still does not guarantee that a molecule will exhibit toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it often has potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of the label "1" for many molecules containing this group. Again, this rule is less reliable than Rules 1 and 2 but still provides useful information about which types of molecules may have potential toxic effects.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), then it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without these functional groups. This rule applies to the first six SMILES strings in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is also more likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to the last two SMILES strings in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least one other non-hydrogen atom, then it may have toxic effects. This rule applies to the seventh SMILES string in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations based on limited data and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for accurate predictions.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F), chlorine (-Cl), bromine (-Br), or iodine (-I) attached to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonium group (-S+-) or a negatively charged sulfur atom bonded to two fluorine atoms (-SF2-), then it is likely to have toxicity activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule is supported by the fact that these functional groups are known to interact with receptors involved in endocrine disruption.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-OPO32-) or a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to one phosphorus and two carbon atoms (-OP(=O)(OC)OC), then it is also likely to have toxicity activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule is supported by the fact that phosphates and their derivatives are known to interfere with hormonal regulation.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it is unlikely to have toxicity activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 0). This rule is supported by the fact that this structural feature is commonly found in non-toxic compounds such as benzoic acid and benzaldehyde.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains two Cl atoms. Therefore, we can assign a label of 1 for this molecule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The second last molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule but its label is 0, which indicates no toxic activity. This suggests that Rule 2 may not be a strong predictor of toxic activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and its label is 1, indicating toxic activity. However, note that there are other molecules in the dataset that do not contain NO2 groups yet they still have toxic activity, so this rule should be used cautiously.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for those molecules. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are known to be associated with toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for some of those molecules. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since other factors such as the position and number of substituents on the ring can also affect toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule does not contain any of the above mentioned structural features, then it may not have significant toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for most of those molecules. However, there may still be exceptions to this rule due to the complexity of biological systems and the many factors that can contribute to toxicity.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) next to a double bond (-C=X where X is any atom except hydrogen), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like CN(C)CCN(C)CCO, C=CCc1ccc(OC)c(OC)c1, CC12CC3CC(C)(C1)CC(N)(C3)C2, and CCC(=O)OCCc1ccccc1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a carbon-carbon triple bond (-C≡C-), then it may not have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like c1ccc2c(c1)CCc1ccccc1N2 and O=C(O)CCCCC(=O)O.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom (S) bonded to two oxygen atoms (O), then it may not have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like COC(=O)CS and N#C/C(

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to a carbon atom that is part of a ring, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like "CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1" and "COc1cc([C@@H]2c3cc4c(cc3C(O[C@@H]3O[C@@H]5CO[C@@H](C)O[C@H]5[C@H](O)[C@H]3O)C3COC(=O)[C@@H]32)OCO4)cc(OC)c1OP(=O)(O)O" which both contain a carbonyl group attached to a cyclic carbon atom.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 16, and 17.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl), then it may also have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway but further analysis would be needed to confirm this. This rule applies to molecules 10, 11, and 12.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain any of these groups, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway and should receive a label of 0. This rule applies to all other molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is more likely to have toxic effects. This is because these functional groups are often associated with harmful chemicals that can disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may have toxic effects due to the ability of the conjugate system to react with other molecules through addition reactions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have toxic effects as well since sulfur dioxide is a known respiratory irritant.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) attached to a benzene ring, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 6, 9, 17, and 28.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 10, 11, 12, and 13.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO3-), then it may be less likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. However, more data would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. This rule applies to molecules 14, 15, 16, and 18.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. The first four molecules in the dataset contain such a group and all have a label of 0.0 indicating no toxicity activity. However, further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis as there may be other factors at play.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because conjugation can increase the reactivity of the carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by amino acid residues in the NR protein. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains both a carbonyl group and an alkene group and has a label of 1.0 indicating toxicity activity. Further studies would need to be conducted to determine if this rule holds true for other molecules containing these functional groups.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (Br), it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. The last two molecules in the dataset contain Br atoms and both have labels of 0.0 indicating no toxicity activity. However, again, further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom bonded to two carbon atoms (i.e. C-Br-C), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 5, 9, and 16.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (i.e. C=O) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, and 15.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (i.e. NO2) or a sulfonyl group (i.e. SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 10, 11, and 14.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:

This rule applies to molecules CO[Si](OC)(OC)OC, O=[Si]=O, C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@@H](CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@@]43C)[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2O, CCSCCSSCCSSSSCOSSCO, CCC(=O)Os1cs(C)nc1, BrCCCCBr, CCS(C)(C)COC(C)(C)C, OC(C)(C)COC(C)(C)C, NCCNS(=O)(=O)[O-], NCNC(=O)ONCP(=O)(OP(=O)([O-])OC[C@H]1[C@@H](NOP(=O)([O-])OC[C@H]1[C@@H](NP(=O)([O-])OC[C@H]1[C@@H](NPP(=O)([O-]

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1).

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains bromine atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset where the presence of bromine atom is indicated by "Br". The label associated with this SMILES string is 0.0 which indicates no toxic activity. However, since only one example is available, further research would be needed to confirm the validity of this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to the twelfth SMILES string in the dataset where the presence of nitro group is indicated by "Nc1cc([N+](=O)[O-])cc([N+](=O)[O-])c1O". The label associated with this SMILES string is 0.0 which indicates no toxic activity. Again, more examples would need to be analyzed to validate this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to several SMILES strings in the dataset such as "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(Br)C(=O)O"

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as they are known to be associated with various health hazards such as cancer, birth defects, and respiratory problems. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a compound contains a chlorine atom bonded to an oxygen atom, then it may also have potential toxic effects due to the high reactivity of chlorine atoms towards other molecules. Therefore, compounds containing Cl-O bonds should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with another double bond or triple bond, then it may have potential toxic effects because such structures can undergo reactions such as addition, elimination, and rearrangement under certain conditions, which can lead to the formation of reactive intermediates and products that can cause harm to living organisms. Therefore, compounds containing C=O conjugated systems should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is likely to have toxic effects and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to molecules CCC(Cl)[N+](=O)[O-], CC(CCc1ccccc1)NCC(O)c1ccc(O)c(C(N)=O)c1, O=C(O)CCC/C=C\C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)C[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1/C=C/[C@@H](O)COc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, COc1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1N, Cc1ccc(C)c(O)c1C, Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2nccs2)cc1, Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2)c1-c1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, NC(=O)c1cccnc1, Cc1ccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)nn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1,

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains bromine atoms, it is more likely to have toxic effects than compounds without bromine atoms. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings Brc1ccccc1 or Oc1c(Br)cc(Br)cc1Br.
Rule 2: Compounds containing carbonyl groups (C=O) tend to have higher toxicity levels compared to those without them. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings O=C(O)c1ccc(O)cc1O or CC(C)CCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC(C)C.
Rule 3: Molecules with nitrogen atoms in their structures may also have increased toxicity levels due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings CCOc1ccccc1N or CCCC1(COC(=O)CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N(c2ccccc2)N(c2ccccc2)C1=O.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic effects and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to molecules like Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1N and CCON=O.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have toxic effects and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to molecules like CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc([C@@H](O)[C@@H](COC(=O)CN)NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)cc1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have toxic effects and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to molecules like COc1ccc(Cl)cc1N and O=C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and may not apply to all types of molecules or biological systems. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for more accurate predictions.

================================

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have toxic effects as indicated by two out of four molecules labeled as 1 containing this functional group. However, there are also several examples where molecules without C=O groups are still labeled as 1, indicating that other factors such as size, shape, and charge distribution may play a role in determining toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules with sulfur atoms appear more likely to have toxic effects than those without them, as seen from five out of six molecules labeled as 1 containing sulfur. This suggests that sulfur-containing compounds may have specific interactions with biological systems that lead to adverse outcomes.
Rule 3: There does not seem to be any clear pattern relating molecular weight or hydrophobicity to toxicity, as both positive and negative labels are found across a range of values for these properties.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a phosphate group (PO4), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the labels for molecules 5, 6, and 7. These groups are commonly found in pesticides and other chemicals that can harm living organisms.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, such as in molecule 9, then it may also have potential toxic effects due to the reactivity of the nitro group. Nitro groups can react with enzymes and other biological molecules, leading to negative health effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as in molecules 18 and 20, then it may also have potential toxic effects because these structures can interact with light and other electromagnetic radiation, potentially causing damage to cells and tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a CCCCN motif, then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The presence of this motif in the molecule may indicate potential binding affinity for the estrogen receptor.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a COC(=O) group, then it is unlikely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule suggests that the carbonyl group present in the molecule may interfere with its ability to bind to the estrogen receptor.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a C=C bond, then it is also unlikely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule suggests that the double bond present in the molecule may disrupt its overall structure and affect its ability to interact with the estrogen receptor.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of the label 1 for those molecules. This rule is supported by research showing that these functional groups can cause adverse health effects such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, and cancer.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of the label 1 for one of the molecules in the dataset. This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing this structural feature can react with DNA and cause mutations.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (Br), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of the label 1 for two of the molecules in the dataset. This rule is supported by research showing that halogenated hydrocarbons such as bromoalkanes can cause reproductive problems, developmental abnormalities, and cancer.
